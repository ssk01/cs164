## TODO: Make Object!

# The base class in our object hierarchy. All other classes must inherit from
# the root Object class. Has two methods:
# 
# 1) new: A constructor-like method that implements prototype-based inheritance.
# All Object instances as well as its subclasses are constructed with this
# method. See http://www.lua.org/pil/16.2.html for details.
